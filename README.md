My History App.

This app uses your age to determine the historical figure with the same age at the time of their passing.

1. When you open android studio, run the app for the code to run. 
3. When the app opens up, follow the instructions to enter the information needed which is the age.
4. The app then processes the information given to display the historical figure that you share an age with at the time of their passing.
5. When you enter an age that is not exactly the same as the historical figure, the code takes the age and checks if it is within a certain range of the figures age.
6. If the age is not withing a certain range, then the app returns an error messages that tells you that there in no historical figure of that age.

Enjoy exploring history though your age.
